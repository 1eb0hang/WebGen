First draft

Trying to make a program to generate code based on instructions given...
this was just a test to see the entering of a command and the output 
of a file.

It worked but it needs worked

- <font style="color:#9737c1;">[DONE]</font>            be able to read diffrent parts of a line as diffrent components
- <font style="color:#9737c1;">[IN PROGRESS]</font>     make commands case non-specific
- when the only char is a space or NULL, it doesnt count as input for cin...fix that cuz that could break program
- need some way of openning and closing files and reopening then with out it being a big deal

TO INFINITY AND BEYOND
